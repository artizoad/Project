<p>Scientists have now started to utilise CRISPR/Cas9 to carry out genetic “surgeries”. This allows them to identify and alter an organism’s genome by replacing or removing specific genetic sequencing on a strand of DNA. Now, CRISPR is being used to alter a cow’s gut microbes with the aim of controlling the animal’s size as well as reducing the amount of methane they produce. Adjusting the microbiomes of cows in this way could produce more meat on less food. This in turn leads to industry efficiency and increased profitability.

Scientists have also begun to engineer crops that can thrive on less water and yield more food. Of course, when messing with genetics in any ecosystem unforeseen challenges could arise there - we’ll have to be highly cautious that we don’t create more problems than we solve.</p>
