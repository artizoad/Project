<p>If climate change continues, scientists warn that food shortages could be more likely which will drive up prices. For this reason, public health officials have been turning their attention towards shoring up food reserves and finding alternative ways of farming.

Drones have many uses in agriculture, but one problem thatâ€™s been in the media a lot recently is around disappearing bees. Indeed some species are even at risk of extinction. This would be disastrous, as bees play a vital economic role as pollinators, helping maintain current agricultural production levels.

Lucky, drones are now being used in experiments to hopefully supplement the pollination efforts that remaining bees are completing. Other ways that agriculture is starting to use drones includes automated crop harvesting, aerial drone photography and even potentially in future as delivery drones.
