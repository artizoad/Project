<p>Ask anyone what they think the future of driving might be, and most people will talk about driverless cars where AI takes full control. What people generally think less about however, is driverless vehicles on farms. Nevertheless Smart Ag, a company based in the USA, has announced its driverless tractor technology in the form of “AutoCart” software. Apparently this software will fully automate a grain cart tractor, providing farmers very welcomed assistance during the busy harvest season. This innovative technological step will allow farmers to automate their existing equipment too, to maximise its capacity and efficiency.

The AutoCart software is actually a cloud-based platform, meaning that these automated agricultural vehicles will become part of the global internet of things (IoT). Essentially however, automated vehicles are only one small piece of IoT innovation and machine learning in agriculture. A new AI system that uses a combination of voice recognition, machine vision, and temperature sensors for example is now being trialled to keep track of the health, wellbeing and location of pigs. Other cases of AI use include highly advanced disease detection in crops using a number of similar techniques.

It’s all exciting stuff, but is clearly just the tip of the iceberg. Much of the true potential of AI has yet to even be realised with the field still being very much in its infancy.</p>
