<h1 style="color:blue;">4. Urban agriculture and vertical farming</h1>

<p>The big thing about urban agriculture in particular is how to make the best use out of what is often very limited farm space. 
Urban farms can by nature be quite small, and could literally just be an outdoor traditional community garden. </p>

<p>However they can still be very valuable, offering an environmentally controlled, self-contained pod. Sometimes they may even be stacked on top of each other - known as vertical farming. And despite the relatively small size, yields from vertical farming can be around ten times more efficient than traditional agriculture. Although vertical farming doesn’t promise to turn the way we farm on its head, it can make huge strides in efficient, productive farming methods.

Traditional farmers could learn a lot from vertical farmers in their design and building structures, making the most of smart design to increase yield and reduce waste.

As the world’s population continues to grow and take up more room, efficiencies in space and farming practices will become all the more essential for feeding ourselves. Unfortunately, no matter how intelligently we design and how high we build, humans are having a massive effect on the environment. Only the continuation of technical advancement in this sector can see us having any chance of keeping up with our own agricultural demands in future.</p>
