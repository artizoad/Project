</marquee>
<p>Whilst many people will have heard of blockchain within the sphere of cryptocurrency finance, the agricultural world is starting to incorporate this innovative new technology in a different way.

Most of the earliest blockchain applications in agriculture were with regard to supply chains and traceability; the status of crops could be recorded and updated using blockchain, right from harvesting through to delivery. The true benefit of this for larger operations in particular is a secure, highly accurate ledger where nothing ever goes missing in transit. All crops that belong to a specific farmer can be traced in real time.

Blockchain can also be used for resource management, like tracking other sensors and equipment for example, or maintaining machinery records.</p>
